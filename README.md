# This project aims to convert personal data into tokens

## Basic Concepts

Data is the cornerstone of the future digital world, especially artificial intelligence. Training AI requires petabytes of data, currently primarily sourced from the internet and public open data sources. However, with data depletion, the generation rate of new data lags far behind training needs, making offline data of significant future value.

Our goal is to structure offline data into a training-ready format, encrypt it, and store it as tokens in a public repository. A paid usage mechanism will be implemented, allowing end-users to monetize their data output, while enterprise users can easily access the data they need through our platform.
